## üè¢ Real-World Example: "Rent a Nerd" Service

Let's walk through setting up a technical consulting service with realistic Norwegian business costs.

### Step 1: Create Cost Items

#### Salary Cost
- **Name**: "Hourly Salary"
- **Price**: 531.59 (kr/hour including taxes and benefits)
- **Period**: Hour
- **Category**: Personnel

#### Office Rent
- **Name**: "Office Rent"
- **Price**: 13,385.78 (kr/month)
- **Period**: Month
- **Category**: Facilities

*Note: We manually calculated this to 63.74 kr/hour based on 21 working days √ó 8 hours = 168 hours/month*

### Step 2: Create the Service Product
- **Name**: "Lei en nerd" (Rent a Nerd)
- **Calculation Model**: Per Resource Unit
- **Expected Resource Units**: 1 (consultant)

### Step 3: Allocate Costs
1. **Salary**: Fixed allocation of 531.59 kr

### Step 4: View Results
**Total hourly cost**: 595.33 kr/hour
